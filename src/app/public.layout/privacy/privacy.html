    <h1>We protect employee data with enterprise standards.</h1>
    <p>
      Wellar AI stores only the data required to deliver wellness insights. We encrypt
      sensitive data in transit and at rest, and we never sell employee information.
      Our goal is to keep scans useful without collecting unnecessary personal data.
